        <div class="para"><br>In colleges if anyone has general grievances about something we need to write it down on a paper and submit it in a grievance box.
               So for solving this problem we are creating an Online Grievance Management System for Student Grievances. Here any student or faculty can
               just easily login and submit their Grievances. This grievance will be redressed by respective Admin of this system. In this system the 
               facility of managing User and their data related to their rights in the authority hierarchy. This data can be easily viewed and modified
               whenever required. This Grievance Redressal System also provides the functionality of providing a monthly report which will used to 
               maintain information about how many grievances are solved in a particular month.<br><br>

                <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>

                We have developed a Grievance Redressal System for submitting grievances online, a user can upload/post his/her grievance from anywhere by using
                this website on the phone or PC Online. Grievance Box was an easy and secure way as compare to other previous methods but due to an online
                complaint box manual effort and wastage of paper is decreased. Users can submit their grievance by easily creating his/her own profile also 
                User can check the current status of their grievances and can view that what kind of action is taken of his/her grievance. Online grievance 
                Redressal System shows the current status of the grievance that whether it is in processes or closed. It is based on centralize management, 
                only the admin can check or solve the grievance. Admin has the authority to remove a User. There is proper Centralized management for checking
                current status of grievance and updating status of grievances. Admin can generate a report of this system in between selected date of his own 
                choice.<br><br>
